# Nau mai, Croeso, Welcome! 

Hello :wave: I am Emily O'Riordan. I'm currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Bodeker Scientific](https://www.bodekerscientific.com/) 
looking at AI methods to improve weather forecasting in Aotearoa New Zealand. I completed my PhD in mathematics from Cardiff University in 2023. 

This website aims to serve as a CV and blog for things I'm interested in. It's very new so hopefully more will be added soon! 

Mā te wā!
