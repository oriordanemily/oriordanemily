I am writing my first post on my GitHub page! I will then run `jekyll serve` to rebuild the site locally and hopefully this post will appear! 

Most of my code is written in python, so below is a snippet of Python code. 

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  return "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom'
{% endhighlight %}
